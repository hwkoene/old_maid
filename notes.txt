My aim will be to make the simulation in such a way that
the functions will closely resemble the steps in a real game.

I would like to make generic functions for cards which I can use to program
this game, but I could also use them to make other card games.

A card game has concepts like cards, players, hands, rounds.

A card can be a tuple of rank and suit or a class. I'll make a stack class
and simulate cards as tuples.
    - I changed this to use ASCII characters for the suits. A card is now a string.

Game classes usually have a 'run()' with a main loop when everything
is initialised.

I realised every game comes down to moving cards between stacks. It always starts
with one stack being the main deck. The players have hands and there can
be a discard pile. Even cards not in the game are on a stack.

The rules didn't describe what happens when one should draw from a player with no cards.
I decided to just skip the player.

The Stack.pick() function includes rudimentary functionality because I expected
to implement more user interaction.
